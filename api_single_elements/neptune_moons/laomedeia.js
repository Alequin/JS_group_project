    "value": "Laomedeia is one of three tiny moons (ranging in size from 30 to 40 km -- or 18 to 24 miles) of Neptune discovered in 2002 using innovative ground-based telescope techniques. (The other moons discovered were Sao and Halimede.) The moons are so distant and so small they are about 100 million times fainter than can be seen with the unaided eye. The moons were missed by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989 because they are so faint and distant from Neptune. Laomedeia is considered an irregular satellite because of its distant, eccentric orbit around Neptune. Like most irregular satellites of the giant planets in our outer solar system, Laomedeia most likely formed after a collision between a larger moon and a comet or an asteroid. Laomedeia and Sao have prograde orbits, which means they orbit in the same direction as Neptune's rotation. Halimede has a retrograde orbit, which means Halimede orbits in the opposite direction of Neptune's rotation. Very little is known about Laomedeia. Scientists are trying to learn more about it and its irregular sisters because they offer a glimpse of the conditions at the time the planets in our solar system were forming billions of years ago.",
