  "name": "Despina",
  "description": "Despina is a tiny moon located within Neptune's faint ring system. The irregularly-shaped moon orbits Neptune every eight hours, circling in the same direction as Neptune's own rotation. Despina remains close to Neptune's equatorial plane. Despina was discovered in late July 1989 from the images taken by the Voyager 2 probe. It was given the temporary designation S/1989 N 3. The discovery was announced (IAUC 4824) on August 2, 1989, but the text only talks of 10 frames taken over 5 days, giving a discovery date of sometime before July 28. The name was given on 16 September 1991.A simulated view of Despina orbiting Neptune Despina is irregularly shaped and shows no sign of any geological modification. It is likely that it is a rubble pile re-accreted from fragments of Neptune's original satellites, which were smashed up by perturbations from Triton soon after that moon's capture into a very eccentric initial orbit.",
