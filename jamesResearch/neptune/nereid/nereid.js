  "name": "Nereid",
  "description": "Nereid is one of the outermost of Neptune's known moons and is the third largest. Nereid is unique because it has one of the most eccentric orbits of any moon in our solar system. It was the second moon of Neptune to be discovered, by Gerard Kuiper in 1949. Nereid orbits Neptune in the prograde direction at an average distance of 5,513,400 km (3,425,900 mi), but its high eccentricity of 0.7507 takes it as close as 1,372,000 km (853,000 mi) and as far as 9,655,000 km (5,999,000 mi). Moons of Neptune are named for characters from Greek or Roman mythology associated with Neptune or Poseidon, or the oceans. Irregular satellites are named for the Nereids, daughters of Nereus and Doris and the attendants of Neptune.",
